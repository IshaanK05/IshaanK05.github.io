                    <p>This project was a self-initiated exploration aimed at deepening my understanding of machine learning, particularly in the domain of computer vision. I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of classifying dog breeds based on input images.</p>
                    
                    <p>The goal was to accurately predict the breed of a dog from a given photograph. To achieve this, I utilized a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing over 20,000 labeled images spanning a wide variety of dog breeds.</p>
                
                    <p>The workflow involved preprocessing the image data, building and training the model using TensorFlow and Keras, and visualizing the training process and results with tools such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib.</p>
                
                    <p>The project not only reinforced my understanding of neural networks and image classification but also gave me practical experience in handling large datasets, optimizing model performance, and evaluating classification metrics.</p>

                    <p>This was a group project that I led, focused on the end-to-end design and development of a smart thermostat. The primary objective was to apply and strengthen our skills in PCB design, embedded systems, and CAD for product development.</p>

                    <p>We began by conducting market research to analyze existing smart thermostats and identify key features and design trends among competitors. Based on our findings, we collaboratively developed an initial concept and system architecture.</p>

                    <p>This included component selection, footprint creation in OrCAD and KiCad, and schematic design. During the PCB layout stage, we carefully considered thermal management, signal integrity, and compliance with industry manufacturing guidelines.</p>

                    <p>In parallel, we designed a custom casing for the thermostat using CAD tools to simulate the final product assembly and ensure mechanical compatibility.</p>

                    <p>Leading this project significantly enhanced my leadership and project management skills, as well as my ability to collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team.</p>

                    <p>This was another group project that I led, focused on designing and building a battery-powered autonomous car capable of completing a track loop in the shortest possible time. The car navigated by detecting a magnetic field generated by a wire embedded beneath the track, using inductors as sensors.</p>

                    <p>To achieve this, we developed a complete signal processing and control system, including a band-pass filter, peak detection circuit, motor control unit, and battery management system.</p>

                    <p>The peak detection circuit extracted directional cues from the magnetic signal and fed this information to an Arduino, which adjusted the car's steering using PWM signals to control each of the motors.</p>

                    <p>Leading this project strengthened my skills in analog circuit design, embedded systems, and sensor integration. It also enhanced my ability to manage a multidisciplinary team and coordinate efforts across hardware and software development.</p>

            More than just a field of study, Computer Systems Engineering is an outlet for innovation. Itâ€™s where hardware meets software, and abstract ideas become real-world solutions. Whether you're building embedded systems, designing PCBs, or optimizing code on a microcontroller, youâ€™re turning complexity into functionality.<br><br>
            You have the power to bridge the physical and digitalâ€”creating systems that control autonomous vehicles, power medical devices, or make homes smarter. Each project is a new challenge: one day youâ€™re soldering components onto a PCB, the next youâ€™re debugging firmware or simulating system behavior.<br><br>
            As a computer systems engineer, you donâ€™t just work with machinesâ€”you bring them to life. The field constantly evolves, pushing you to learn, adapt, and create. And nothing beats the feeling of seeing something you builtâ€”something that once lived only in a schematicâ€”working in the real world.
